This game is designed to be a trivia game of topics that I personally like. For example, there are questions on tennis, music,
and a show I like. The trivia game comes with 30 questions that are worth 3.33 points each. At the end of the game, the players score is
calculated for them and given to them. Good luck players!


(The years for when the songs are released are just from google searches, tennis facts are from a fun fact website, and the show questions I thought of on the spot.)
